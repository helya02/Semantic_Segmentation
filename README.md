# Semantic Segmentation Models 
 
This repository contains implementations of three popular semantic segmentation models: UNET, FPN, and PSPNet. These models are commonly used for pixel-level classification tasks in computer vision. 
 
## Models 
 
### UNET 
 
The UNET architecture is a popular choice for semantic segmentation tasks. It consists of an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections. The encoder captures the context information, while the decoder recovers spatial information using skip connections. 
 
### FPN (Feature Pyramid Network) 
 
FPN is another widely used architecture for semantic segmentation. It leverages a feature pyramid to capture multi-scale information. The network combines low-level and high-level features to generate accurate segmentation maps. 
 
### PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network) 
 
PSPNet utilizes a pyramid pooling module to capture global contextual information at different scales. It effectively integrates information from different receptive fields, enhancing the segmentation performance.
